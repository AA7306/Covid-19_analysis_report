# COVID-19 Data Analysis in India

## Overview
This project presents an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of COVID-19 trends in India using publicly available datasets. The analysis focuses on **state-wise infection patterns, recovery and mortality rates, and vaccination progress** to extract meaningful insights from real-world pandemic data.

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate **data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and analytical reasoning** using Python.

## Problem Statement
During the COVID-19 pandemic, large volumes of data were released by government and public health organizations. However, raw datasets often contained inconsistencies, missing values, and unstructured information, making it difficult to extract actionable insights.

This project aims to:
- Clean and preprocess COVID-19 case and vaccination data
- Derive key metrics such as active cases, recovery rates, and mortality rates
- Perform state-wise comparative analysis
- Visualize trends to support data-driven understanding of the pandemic in India

---

## Datasets Used
- COVID-19 India Statewise Dataset  
- COVID-19 Vaccination Statewise Dataset  

**Data Sources:**
- Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India  
- World Health Organization (WHO)  
- Our World in Data  

Datasets are stored in the `data/` directory.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)

---

## Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (active cases, recovery rate, mortality rate)
- State-wise aggregation of confirmed, recovered, and death cases
- Identification of:
  - Top states with highest active cases
  - States with highest mortality
  - Vaccination leaders and laggards
- Trend analysis of COVID-19 waves across major Indian states
- Gender-based vaccination distribution analysis

---

## Key Insights
- A small number of highly populated states accounted for a disproportionate share of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
- Recovery and mortality rates varied significantly across states, reflecting differences in healthcare capacity and response.
- Vaccination coverage showed regional and demographic disparities.
- Temporal trends revealed multiple waves of infections with varying peak periods across states.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure the datasets are present in the `data/` directory
3. Open the notebook:
4. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations

---

## Notes & Limitations
- This project focuses on **exploratory and descriptive analysis**
- It does **not** include predictive modeling or forecasting
- Results depend on the quality and completeness of publicly available data

---

## Project Credits
This project was developed as part of an **academic group case study**.  
The version shared here is adapted for **portfolio and learning purposes**.
